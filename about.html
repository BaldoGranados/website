            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! If you don't know already, my name is Baldo, and I am currently a Finance student at Cornell University. 
            I was born and raised in Austin, Texas, which makes me a native Texan (Texas is the best). I have a twin sister, 
            Annika, who is two minutes older than me, is in the National Guard, and is a University of Texas student on the track to becoming a lawyer.</p>
            <p>In my downtime, I journal, listen to podcasts, and stay active by weight lifting, running, or playing any sport. Team sports have always been an 
            essential part of my life. Since I was three, I have played t-ball, soccer, gymnastics, football, basketball, lacrosse, and most recently, badminton. 
            Lacrosse was the sport I spent the most time playing throughout school, and it introduced me to weight lifting and running, which I keep up with today. 
            Watching sports, I grew up going to UT college football games, which made me a lifelong fan. It is still the team I watch every Saturday during the season.</p>
            <p>I am also passionate about learning through journaling, reading, and podcasting. These activities give me a way to explore new ideas and express myself. 
            Some of my favorite books and podcasts challenge my beliefs and expand my perspective. My favorite podcast is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44">Joe 
            Rogan Experience #1309 - Naval Ravikant</a>, and my favorite book is Atomic Habits. I'm still trying to read more fiction books, but it's less entertaining to me.</p>
